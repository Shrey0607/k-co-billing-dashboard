📊 KCO Billing Dashboard
🚀 Introduction

KCO Billing Dashboard is a simple internal web app that demonstrates multi-cloud cost visibility. It reads sample billing exports (AWS / GCP), consolidates and processes them on a small Node.js/Express backend, and displays the results in a React dashboard UI.

🎯 Purpose

The app is intended as a take-home assignment to show:

Full-stack ability – End-to-end application development

Data transformation – Processing and consolidating cloud billing data

Clean UI – User-friendly and intuitive interface

Readable code structure – Well-organized and maintainable codebase

✨ Features
🔹 Data Loading

Load sample AWS & GCP cloud billing data from the backend

🔹 Data Table View

Displays billing records with the following columns:

Date

Cloud Provider

Service

Team

Environment (prod / staging / dev)

Cost (USD)

🔹 Sorting & Filtering

Sorting: By date and cost

Filters:

Cloud provider (AWS / GCP / All)

Team

Environment (prod / staging / dev / All)

Month (YYYY-MM)

🔹 Summary Cards

Total spend (filtered)

Spend by cloud provider (AWS / GCP)

🔹 Additional Features

Detail view modal on row click

Monthly spend bar chart visualization

Basic responsive dashboard layout suitable for desktop

🔹 User Experience

Graceful handling of application states:

📌 Assumptions Made

Billing format fields are consistent across cloud providers

All costs are in USD

"month" filter uses the first 7 characters of date (YYYY-MM)

Data does not exceed memory limitations of static load

No user authentication required for this internal dashboard

Dashboard will primarily be viewed on desktop web

✔️ What's Completed

Fully working backend API

Cloud + Team + Env + Month filters

Sorting by Date & Cost

Detail modal on row click

Summary card with totals

Monthly spend chart

CSV transformation into unified JSON dataset

Simple but clean UI design

Graceful UX states

Error handling

Responsive container layout

🔮 What I Would Do Next (With More Time)

Add search functionality (filter by service name)

Data persistence via SQLite or MongoDB instead of static JSON

Authentication for users & roles
